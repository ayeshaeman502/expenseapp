# Expense Tracker App

The Expense Tracker App is a simple Android application that allows users to add expenses, categorize them, and view a summary of their expenses in both pie chart and bar chart formats.

## Features

- **Add Expenses**: Users can add expenses with a specified category and amount.
- **View Expense Summary**: Users can view their expenses summarized in graph charts (showing total expenses).
- **Data Persistence**: Expenses are stored locally using Room, so data is preserved even if the app is closed.
